### **Project Description** üìú

This project is a personal portfolio website for a full-stack developer named Sunny.  It showcases Sunny's skills, projects, and experience in a visually appealing and interactive manner. The website is designed to be responsive, working seamlessly across different devices.  It's useful for Sunny to present their work to potential employers or clients and to establish an online presence.  The site includes smooth animations, particle effects, and a custom cursor for an enhanced user experience.

**Highlighted Sections:**

* **About:**  A brief introduction to Sunny and their background.
* **Skills:** A visually engaging display of technical proficiencies.
* **Projects:** A portfolio showcasing completed projects with links to GitHub and live demos.
* **Experience:** A timeline highlighting Sunny's professional experience.
* **Contact:** A contact form and social media links to get in touch.


### **Installation Instructions** üíæ

This project is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website.  No server-side setup is required.  To view the portfolio:

1. **Save the code:** Save the provided HTML code as `index.html`.
2. **Create necessary folders:** Create a folder and Save the `imageicon.png` in that folder (if you want to use a custom favicon).
3. **Open in browser:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.

This method involves downloading all external resources like CSS frameworks and libraries each time the page is loaded, leading to longer load times.  For an optimal experience, consider using a local web server or bundling tools like Webpack or Parcel to manage the project.


### **Features** ‚ú®

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Smooth Animations:**  Uses GSAP for elegant animations and transitions.
* **Parallax Scrolling:**  Not explicitly implemented but could be added.
* **Custom Cursor:**  Adds an interactive and visually engaging cursor.
* **Particle Effects:** Adds a subtle visual touch to the Hero section.
* **Project Filtering:** Ability to filter projects by category.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Smooth transitions between sections.
* **Contact Form:**  A simple contact form (currently without backend functionality).
* **Social Media Links:**  Links to Sunny's social media profiles.


### **Usage Instructions** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Once the `index.html` file is opened in a web browser, users can navigate through the different sections using the navigation bar or by scrolling.  They can view Sunny's skills, projects, experience, and contact information.  The project filters allow users to easily browse projects based on their type.  The contact form can be used to send a message (though it currently lacks server-side processing).

* **Font Awesome:** For icons.
